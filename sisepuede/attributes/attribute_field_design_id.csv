``field``,``description``
``design_id``,Integer index for experimental designs. 0 is baseline by convention.
``vary_lever_deltas``,"Binary (1 or 0). A 1 indicates that this design will quantify uncertainty around the lever deltas, and a 0 will leave the lever delta fixed (for each strategy)."
``vary_uncertainties``,"Binary (1 or 0). A 1 indicates that this design will quantify uncertainty around incertidumbres (parameters of type incertidumbre), and a 0 will only assess fixed trajectories (no variation under futures)."
``linear_transform_ld_m``,"Real number, gives the value of :math:`m` in :math:`d(x)`."
``linear_transform_ld_b``,"Real number, gives the value of :math:`b` in :math:`d(x)`."
``min_lever_deltas``,"Real number, gives the value of :math:`a_0` in :math:`d(x)`."
``max_lever_deltas``,"Real number, gives the value of :math:`a_1` in :math:`d(x)`."
``experimental_design``,The name of the design.
``include``,"Binary (1 or 0). A 1 indicates that this design will be included in the analysis, while a 0 indicates it will not be included."
