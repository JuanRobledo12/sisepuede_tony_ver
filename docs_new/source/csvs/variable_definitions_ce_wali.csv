Input,(Optional) Elasticity of Protein in Diet to GDP per Capita,"Used if run indepedently from the AFOLU model. In the integrated modeling framework, growth in demand per capita for livestock is used to estimate growth in protein contained in diets. However, the model may be run in isolation. In this case, users can use an elasticity in combination with the fraction of the population that does not eat red meat.",``elasticity_protein_in_diet_to_gdppc``,none,,0,0.8,1.2,,0,,

Then `Andreoli et al. (2021) <https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/13/7399/htm>`_ was used to estimate that protein consumption in latin america from animal protein was approximately 27.5 grams per person per day in 1984, which then grew to 37.5 by 2017 (an increase of 10 grams per day).
